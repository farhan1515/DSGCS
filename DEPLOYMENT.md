## Fixing 404 Errors on Direct URL Access

### Problem

When accessing direct URLs like `https://asitlog1.vercel.app/services` or `https://asitlog1.vercel.app/about`, you get a 404 error because Vercel doesn't know how to handle client-side routes.

### Solution

We've implemented multiple layers of routing protection:

#### 1. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This tells Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle the routing.

#### 2. Fallback Routes (`public/_redirects`)

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This provides a backup routing solution.

#### 3. React Router Catch-All Route

Added a `*` route in App.tsx to handle unmatched paths gracefully.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push your changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix routing issues for direct URL access"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**

   - Vercel should automatically redeploy when you push changes
   - If not, manually trigger a redeploy from your Vercel dashboard

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Test direct URL access: `https://asitlog1.vercel.app/services`
   - Test direct URL access: `https://asitlog1.vercel.app/about`
   - Test direct URL access: `https://asitlog1.vercel.app/careers`
   - Test direct URL access: `https://asitlog1.vercel.app/contact`

### How It Works

1. **User visits** `/services` directly
2. **Vercel receives** the request and matches the rewrite rule
3. **Vercel serves** `index.html` instead of looking for a `/services` file
4. **React Router** takes over and renders the correct component
5. **User sees** the Services page as expected

### Additional Benefits

- **SEO friendly**: Direct URLs work properly
- **Bookmarkable**: Users can bookmark any page
- **Shareable**: Links can be shared and accessed directly
- **Professional**: Behaves like standard industry websites

### Troubleshooting

If you still get 404 errors after deployment:

1. **Clear Vercel cache**: Sometimes Vercel caches old configurations
2. **Check deployment logs**: Ensure the new `vercel.json` was deployed
3. **Verify file structure**: Make sure `vercel.json` is in the root directory
4. **Wait for propagation**: DNS and CDN changes can take a few minutes

### Testing

After deployment, test these scenarios:

- ✅ Direct URL access to all pages
- ✅ Browser back/forward buttons
- ✅ Page refresh on any route
- ✅ Deep linking from external sources
- ✅ Social media sharing links
